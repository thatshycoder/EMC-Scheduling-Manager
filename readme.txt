== Disclaimer == 

This is an unofficial plugin for integrating Calendly features into WordPress.

The free version comes with optional promotion notices that can be easily disabled by clicking the "Don't show again" button, near the notice.

These notices are shown in your admin dashboard, and once any of them is disabled, all other promotion notices from EMC Scheduling Manager are disabled.

You can upgrade to the [pro version](https://simpma.com/emc/pricing/) to automatically disable all promotion notices.

Optionally, you can disable the promotions by also including the below code snippet in your theme's function.php file:

`

add_filter('emcs_promotions', 'emcs_show_promotions');

function emcs_show_promotions() {
	return false; 
}
